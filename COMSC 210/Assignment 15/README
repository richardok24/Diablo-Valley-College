Program I/O. Input: As prompted, a start city. Output: The BFS-based list of cities reachable from start. Here's what the result should be for the start city of San Francisco:

Part 2

Write GraphSearchDFS.cpp, by modifying the Part 1 CPP. Replace the doBreadthFirstSearch BFS function with doDepthFirstSearch, doing DFS based on the algorithm in the module.

Remember to use reverse iteration where it's indicated in the DFS algorithm, and remember that iterator::end is not a valid node! There are several ways to do this, and for (it = x.end(); it! = x.begin(i); it--) is not one of them.
